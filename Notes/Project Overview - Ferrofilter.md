The objective of the ferrofilter project is to investigate possible implementations  (and their viability) for the purpose of microplastic filtering.

The first steps of the project is to simulate simple cases and characterize the general behaviour. More details in [[Simulation]] 

We also need to find ways to characterize the concentration profile of the microplastics suspended in the liquid. It will also be useful to characterize the fluid and magnetic properties of the ferrofluid. This is the purpose of [[Experiments]] 

Eventually we will want to compare the best setup with already available methods. This should be done almost exclusively through simulations, while also being grounded on experimental evidence (on simple setups).
